# Jacks_solita_repo
This is my first training repository for the 2024 Solita Data Academy


## adding something to test git and ssh functionality
New computer, who dis?

## What better way to spend your wednesday then testing your git functionality
The many ants who forage, among the undergrowth
Know nothing of our world, we who want to see
Their struggles and strife, yet we cannot know
What emotions might be evoked within their minds

We are as alien to them as they to us
Our worlds forever divided
